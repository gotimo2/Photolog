# Photolog

An app that reminds you to take a photo every day, configurably.

### Why?

because i wanted to take photos more often but always forget to. Just using a reminder leads to me just ignoring the notification, so i made an app that generates ongoing notifications that i can't just swipe away.

### How?

.NET MAUI Blazor hybrid, using [Plugin.LocalNotification](https://github.com/thudugala/Plugin.LocalNotification) for notifications, [Xamarin.MediaGallery](https://github.com/dimonovdd/Xamarin.MediaGallery) for Media gallery integration, and [Animate.css](https://animate.style/) with [Pico.css](https://picocss.com/) for styling.

#### Where?

You can find photolog on Google Play [here.](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dotshell.photolog)
